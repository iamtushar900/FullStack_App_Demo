# FullStack_App_Demo
 Created A Online Education App Demo.
 Tech Stack Used -  React js , Node js , Express js , MongoDB , MD Bootsrap .
 It's a fullstack app so you need to Start the Node server present in the backend by "npm run dev" and start the react app by "npm start" command.
 The HTTP Server is connected to Login and Signup in Frontend part using "CORS".
 I performed a private routing also , it means User Whose data already exists he can acces a page "Private page".
